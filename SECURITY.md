## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Contact Information

**Primary Contact:** MagistrTheOne  
Email:** magistrtheone@protonmail.com  
**PGP Key:** [Available upon request]  
**Response SLA:** 48 hours for critical, 7 days for non-critical

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Send encrypted email to magistrtheone@protonmail.com with:
   - Subject: `[SECURITY] Oracle850B Vulnerability Report`
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information

### What to Include

- **Vulnerability Type:** Model extraction, data poisoning, prompt injection, etc.
- **Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Affected Components:** Model weights, training data, inference pipeline
- **Proof of Concept:** If available (encrypted)
- **Suggested Fix:** If you have recommendations

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment:** Within 7 days
3. **Detailed Analysis:** Within 14 days
4. **Fix Development:** Timeline depends on severity
5. **Disclosure:** Coordinated disclosure after fix

### Security Considerations

#### Model Security
- **Weight Protection:** Model weights are encrypted and access-controlled
- **Inference Security:** Rate limiting and input validation
- **Data Privacy:** No user data is stored or logged

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Access Control:** Multi-factor authentication required
- **Network Security:** VPN and firewall protection
- **Monitoring:** 24/7 security monitoring and alerting

#### Research Security
- **Code Review:** All changes require security review
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets Management:** Secure storage of API keys and credentials

### Known Limitations

- **Model Extraction:** Theoretical risk of model extraction attacks
- **Data Poisoning:** Training data quality depends on source verification
- **Prompt Injection:** Standard prompt injection vulnerabilities apply
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Potential for DoS through resource-intensive requests

### Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Rate Limiting:** Implement appropriate rate limits
3. **Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual patterns or attacks
4. **Updates:** Keep dependencies and infrastructure updated
5. **Access Control:** Use principle of least privilege

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not operate a formal bug bounty program. However, we appreciate responsible disclosure and may provide recognition for significant security contributions.
